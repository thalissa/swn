## Stars Without Number
Stars Without Number system for FoundryVTT, compatible for all editions and with a multitude of options for running the game!

### Developer Notes
If you'd like to follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThalissaRemnant), I retweet mostly tabletop stuff and cool art over there and will occasionally post updates about things I'm working on. Additionally I have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thalissa) if you'd like to support me!

### Contributors
Those that assist in contributing to the project will be listed here! Though I expect no help, if anyone provides any assistance I'll be more than happy to pull code in.

### Changelog
#### 0.1.11 (Documentation Here Update)
* Cleaned up documentation around the files and learned I use the word "various" too much.
* Fixed item sheets so that they properly prepare and update data again, and fixed a styling edit.
* Removed attributes section from item sheets; appropriate fields will be added later.

#### 0.1.10 (Fix The Broken Things Update)
* Update 0.1.8 and 0.1.9 were accidentally merged at the same time, so if you're looking for separate commits between them, now you know why the one for 0.1.8 is missing!
* When rolling a skill, an attribute dialogue comes up that the player can select from.
* Rolls will now show the modifiers used in the flavourtext section. Plan to tweak how this is displayed later, but this is good for now.

#### 0.1.9 (Graphics Are Cool Update)
* Updated a bunch of styling on the sheet! Now using a [cool background from Hubble](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2020/58/4778-Image) that's in the [public domain](https://hubblesite.org/copyright)! In the future I'll add a "Credits" section inside Foundry for this and any future images I use as well.

#### 0.1.8 (Skills Update)
* Finally found a version of the skills page I liked.
* Settings page now has more settings, such as being able to disable individual skills!
* Psionic skills won't show up if the character doesn't have the psionic tab enabled.
