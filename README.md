### Developer Notes
If you'd like to follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThalissaRemnant), I retweet mostly tabletop stuff and cool art over there and will occasionally post updates about things I'm working on. Additionally I have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thalissa) if you'd like to support me!

### Contributors
Those that assist in contributing to the project will be listed here! Though I expect no help, if anyone provides any assistance I'll be more than happy to pull code in.

### Changelog
#### 0.1.15 (Separation Of NPC-and-PC)
* Better separated the NPC and PC sheet functions. Small update, but important for the future.

#### 0.1.14 (NPCs Are People Too Update)
* Added better templating to the template templates so I can template better between the templates.
* NPC sheets are now visually distinct (AKA all the non-important stuff is taken out) from the player sheet. No more lazy copy-pasting between the two!
* Added more attributes and modified the header of the PC and NPC sheets to adjust for the new fields.

#### 0.1.13 (Localizations-R-Us Update)
* A lot of localization additions and fixes.
* Additionally, I better separated the sheet partials between various folders.

#### 0.1.12 (Styling Fixes Update)
* Added comments to the style sheets and better organized them while I did that.
* Made the pages that needed styling have them (Example: You can read the equipment list now!)

#### 0.1.11 (Documentation Here Update)
* Cleaned up documentation around the files and learned I use the word "various" too much.
* Fixed item sheets so that they properly prepare and update data again, and fixed a styling edit.
* Removed attributes section from item sheets; appropriate fields will be added later.
